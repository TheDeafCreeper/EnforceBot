# Enforce

A Discord moderation bot made for servers, not profit.

The goal of Enforce is to give you all the features of other premium bots and more, all without requiring you to pay a dime.

Note: 
In theory if you setup a database and compile the code as is it should work, it just currently does not meet Strict TS requirements.
